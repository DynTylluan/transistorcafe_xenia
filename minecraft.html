<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a fan of Minecraft big shocker, I know. Now let me give you a tore of my base</p>

					<p>Oh that? Yeah. that goes to <strong>The Gay World</strong>... what do you mean we're already there? Well, okay...</p>

					<p>So yeah, that's my Minecraft world. I thought it would be cool if I were to make a page dedicated to it, despite my world not even being a week old yet! Hopefully, you liked it as much as I do. Oh, by the way, it's not vanilla Minecraft! I'm using a mod called Better than Adventure! (<a href="https://bta.miraheze.org">bta.miraheze.org</a>) that's very cool and is along the lines of "what if beta 1.7.3 never stopped?" - it's good fun!</p>
